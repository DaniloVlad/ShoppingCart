# ShoppingCart
Node/expressjs backend with react frontend. The sites checkout is fully integerated with paypal payments.  Only the webhook listener needs to be done for updating the db after purchase.

## Server
  1) Routes: Folder contains all the app routes.
  2) Middlewares: Folder contains all logic for handling various requests on the routes
  3) Models: Folder contains all of the sql queries

## Client
  The client was stitched together for display purposes. Has a lot of refactoring and reorganization that needs to be done. All the react components are found in src/.  The structure here is very messy.
